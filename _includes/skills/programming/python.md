I've done some basic projects with Python in complex dynamic networks area using NetworkX, and Epidemics algorithms using ndlib. I've analyzed data of websites like Twitter and Stackoverflow for useful information. You can also check out my [Scikit Heart Disease Classifer](https://github.com/avestura/scikit-heart-disease-classifier) where I used SVM Classification, Decision Trees, grid search cross validiation, PCA, and Cost complexity pruning and visualized data using Confusion Matrix, ROC and Decision surface/region.

 I know HTML 5 and I've designed some templates for Blog.ir (A blogging service in Iran). I've also done some front-end projects for a company in Tehran, capital of Iran.

 See the vanilla template I've created for my Events website without using any frameworks or 3rd party libraries: [Event Eater Template](https://avestura.dev/EventTemplate/)

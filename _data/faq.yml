    - q: .NET, Azure, Windows. Are you vendor locked-in by Microsoft?
      a: Even tho I am skilled in Microsoft Technologies, I am comfortable and open to use and learn other techs,
         solutions and approaches. I do like Microsoft a lot, but also a criticizer to its solutions and policies. In summary,
         *I don't belive that I'm vendor locked-in by MS as I embrace and use every tech that looks cool to me.*

    - q: Which one do you prefer? Object-oriented or Functional Programming?
      a: Obviously Functional Programming. I find Functional Programming easier to reason about the code, and it helps you to do much
         more with less code. It's safer, and fits my soul. There are already sources in this website that proves this claim.

    - q: Are you willing to work with us?
      a: I'm always open to hear about new opportunities.
